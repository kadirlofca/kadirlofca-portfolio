## Overview

I am an active maintainer and contributor of [**Santai.GG**](http://Santai.GG), an all-in-one platform for Spectre Divide news, leaderboards, and player statistics. I use technologies such as **TypeScript**, **Go**, **Postgres**, and **React** to build the frontend, backend, and even a Discord bot!

## Technologies Used

### 1\. **Frontend Development (React, Svelte, Tailwind, Next.js, Astro)**

I was responsible for designing and implementing user-facing components that were both visually appealing and user-friendly. Here's how I contributed:

*   **Astro**: When I first joined the project, I suggested to use Astro in order develop the project quickly as the meta framework is able to utilize React, Svelte, and many other frameworks together, leading to a greater ecosystem for us. I rewrote the entire frontend and realized how mentally taxing it was to switch between the syntaxes of these different frameworks. So I ultimately decided against Astro and moved the project back into Next.js and React.
    

*   **React**: React to build dynamic and interactive components on the website, ensuring that users could easily navigate between different pages and access the platform’s features.
    

### 2\. **Backend Development (Go)**

On the backend, I leveraged **Go** (Golang) to build a high-performance API layer that powers [Santai.GG](http://Santai.GG)’s core services. Go’s concurrency model made it ideal for handling a large number of simultaneous requests and real-time data processing, which is critical for the platform. My contributions included:

*   Building RESTful APIs to handle data storage and retrieval, user management, and service integrations.
    
*   Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure the security of user data and platform integrity.
    
*   Integrating third-party services and APIs to enhance the functionality of [Santai.GG](http://Santai.GG).
    
*   Writing efficient, scalable code that could handle growing traffic and user activity without compromising performance.
    

### 3\. **Discord Bot Development**

As part of the project, I also contributed to the development and maintenance of the [Santai.GG](http://Santai.GG) **Discord bot**, which plays a crucial role in community engagement. The bot allows users to interact with [Santai.GG](http://Santai.GG) services directly through Discord, offering real-time game updates, event notifications, and user-specific features. Key tasks included:

*   Writing the bot in **TypeScript** using the **Discord.js** library, ensuring a smooth integration with the Discord API.
    
*   Implementing features like command parsing, event handling, and real-time messaging, allowing users to access personalized information and participate in community events directly from Discord.
    
*   Ensuring the bot’s scalability by optimizing its performance and handling error states gracefully.
    

\## Key Contributions

*   **Frontend Features**: Developed and maintained various interactive UI elements using React and Svelte, ensuring responsive and smooth user experiences across desktop and mobile devices.
    
*   **Backend Architecture**: Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Go, improving the platform’s scalability and performance.
    
*   **API Integrations**: Integrated third-party APIs to offer enhanced functionalities such as real-time game stats, user management, and notification systems.
    
*   **Discord Bot**: Developed the Discord bot to extend the platform's functionality, offering users a seamless experience in the gaming community.
    
*   **Optimization & Maintenance**: Continuously monitored performance metrics, identifying areas for optimization both in the frontend and backend, ensuring the platform's responsiveness even under high load.
    

## Conclusion

My work on the [**Santai.GG**](http://Santai.GG) project has been an incredible experience, as it involved solving complex problems across various domains, from frontend to backend, and integrating external platforms like Discord. By leveraging technologies like **TypeScript**, **Go**, **React**, **Svelte**, and **Astro**, I was able to create a modern, performant, and user-friendly platform that serves a growing community of users. The project has been a great example of how combining cutting-edge technologies with a focus on user experience can lead to a successful and scalable solution.
